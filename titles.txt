 and we realise that cooperation is not always easy. We saw an example just before with the case of the transponders. The planes can still fly at least. 
 areas where innocent people’s lives are at stake. You mentioned recently the case of the Tsarnayev brothers. As far as I know
 if I recall correctly. Yes
 but they do say quite rightly that this is essential for all of us
 the Americans have provided us with real help
 we have quite a good situation in this area with our European partners. We have open and professional contacts with the French intelligence services
 and also emphasis on the roadmap that we saw in Russia
 so as not to put anyone in a difficult position or interfere with the process itself. As you know
 not by law
 Ukraine and its Parliament adopted an amendment
 as it was part of the Minsk Agreements and is
 temporarily
 the Ukrainian president suddenly also attempted to change this proposal
 really. But in principle
 the discussions proceed with difficulty
 Russia recently withdrew from an agreement with the United States to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium
 I’m optimistic about that. Are we to understand
 they will tell you about the concept of ‘starting position’. As for our decision on the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement
 but said that it would not do so because of financial difficulties. As if Russia does not have financial difficulties of its own
 in other words
 my question is on Russian policy towards Asia. The emphasis today in Russian foreign policy is on the construction of a multipolar world. But do you also give some thought to the importance of a multipolar Asia? Both in your speech today
 by its emphasis on a multipolar world
 but simply because life itself dictates this choice. Why do I say that life itself dictates that we expand these contacts? 
 and
 we see that Asia is not unipolar and this is very evident. 
 and we are ready to work the same way with them all. 
 as well as in the civilian sector
 at the Valdai Club
 and still do today
 before putting my question
 to what extent will future systems resemble past ones? What are the positive components we should emphasise in particular? Should we seek more universality or more diversity as far as principles go? What kind of combination of components would you prefer to see? 
 the West

 of course not. How is this possible? Does today’s China resemble the China of the 1960s-70s? They are two completely different countries
 they are deeply mistaken. If we follow this kind of thinking
 that the world really will become more multipolar
 the United States
 Centre for Political Technology. 
 Ukraine is constantly trying to prohibit things Russian. We get the impression that everything Russian is being squeezed out of Ukrainian life. In this respect
 seeing it as one of the pillars of economic policy
 including from Ukraine. Mr Poroshenko is one of our investors in the sense that he is the owner of a sizeable business in Lipetsk Region
 Canada 
 I already put this question yesterday to the Deputy Foreign Minister
 I do not know how accurate they are
 I do not need to recall it because I never forgot it. It was a very important conversation. There was indeed talk on the lines that Russian and Syrian aircraft would cease their airstrikes against terrorist targets in Aleppo until the healthy opposition forces could be separated from the forces of Jabhat al-Nusra
 I note that it is no secret that our American partners promised to do this. First
 we agreed that we would decide right there on the battlefield who the moderates were
 my American partner
 our American partners broke the ceasefire themselves. I had originally insisted that they first separate the terrorists from the moderates and we would then end the airstrikes
 I think
 you should ask him. I imagine that he will speak with our European partners about this when he goes to Europe. I think this should be done openly and honestly and not simply in an attempt to use this to influence our position on Syria. 
 do you realise that Russian and Syrian aircraft have not been carrying out any operations around Aleppo for 9 days now. We gave them not 7 days
 but we do have to try to keep our promises. In any case

 Donetsk and Lugansk. I was the only one there who supported him. It is another matter that I do not describe this as a policing mission because the other parties in the process have objected to it. They objected not because they do not want to help Mr Poroshenko
 the other parties in the process have not supported the idea Mr Poroshenko advanced
 if Mr Poroshenko believes that this would help the cause
 please. 
 former President of Austria Mr Fischer said that the relationship between the EU and Russia is not as expected 25 years ago. It’s unfortunate
 since ideological differences
 as we found out
 he said
 some of them did not want to change anything
 I hope that as the global alignment of forces in the world changes
 the European Union had 12 members: Sweden
 Russia was different


 in the opinion of our specialists – and they are no worse than Ukrainian experts because in Soviet times this was a single complex – we do realise what is going on there. 
 it is necessary to pump the required amount of gas into underground gas storage facilities. This gas is for transit
 they have already started to syphon it off. These are grounds for concern. I discussed gas shipments to Ukraine with the Ukrainian President at his initiative. He wanted to know whether Russia could resume deliveries. Of course
 for instance
 so be it. By the way
 okay
 which is under a lot of pressure today as I am sure you are aware; there are lots of bitter mutual recriminations
 if other countries followed Russia and the United States. Here’s what we have: the naive former Russian leadership went ahead and eliminated intermediate-range land-based missiles. The Americans eliminated their Pershing missiles
 but the treaty did not include medium-range sea- and air-based missiles. Air- and sea-based missiles were not affected by it. The Soviet Union simply did not have them
 in the air
 including the countries to the east of our borders
 of course. I fully agree that we should at least try to break this vicious circle. But we were not the first to start drawing it. Quite to the contrary
 that our interests would be respected

 when you split it into several republics
 no bombing raids and no casualties. No one died there. The only thing we did was to ensure the free expression of will by the people
 parliament approved a secession resolution
 we can keep exchanging caustic remarks
 these agreements are not implemented.

Benny Morris’s Untenable Denial of the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine

 Moshe Shertok
 Ben-Gurion understood the Arab perspective perfectly well. With respect to the 1936–1939 Arab Revolt
 after the establishment of Israel
 this assumption reveals his own demonstrable prejudice toward the Palestinians. In truth
 the British came to occupy the territory of Palestine
 and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object
 which became known as “The Balfour Declaration”
 it was for “propaganda reasons”. The aforementioned 1937 British commission headed up by Lord William Peel explained that “it was believed that Jewish sympathy or the reverse would make a substantial difference one way or the other to the Allied cause. In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry . . . .” The Zionist leaders promised that
 the Peel Commission further remarked

 . . . but also by more responsible representatives of Zionism
 in fact
 as well
1918
1919
 be it right or wrong
 Balfour added
 “It was never doubted that the experiment”—meaning the Zionist project—“would have to be controlled by one of the Great Powers; and to that end it was agreed . . . that Palestine should have its place in the new Mandate System . . . .” [42] 
 but was effectively written by the Zionists themselves. As the Peel Commission pointed out: 
 dated the 28th of March
 given the Zionists’ role in drafting the Mandate
 May 1948 ( John Phillips/Life Magazine ) The Expropriation of the Land 
 the Mandate facilitated the process of expropriation and removal of the poor Arab peasants by the Zionists
 to the end that the same shall be held as the inalienable property of the Jewish people. . . . The Agency shall promote agricultural colonization based on Jewish labour
 land settlement
 we were told


 there can be no doubt that the Arab has profited largely by the installation of the colonies. Relations between the colonists and their Arab neighbours were excellent. In many cases
 in travelling through the P.I.C.A. villages
 history would undoubtedly have been very different. Alas
 but the General Federation of Jewish Labour is using every effort to ensure that it shall be extended to the colonies of the P.I.C.A.
 the state effectively claimed ownership of the land and individuals were regarded as tenants. Subsequently
 especially in the latter half of the eighteenth century
 with extreme prejudice toward the poor Arab inhabitants who by rights were its legitimate owners. [52] According to the Shaw Commission
 by the end of the Mandate
 while the Jews would be awarded about 55 percent for their state
 we can now return to Benny Morris’s argument that “the Palestinians were the ones who started the war when they rejected the UN compromise plan and embarked on hostile acts”. This argument assumes that the Arabs’ rejection of the plan was somehow unreasonable. It was not . 
 the partition plan was actually never implemented. Resolution 181 merely recommended that Palestine be partitioned and referred the matter to the Security Council
 in truth
 what he really means
 while the Jews were simply defending themselves. For example
 “From the end of November 1947 until the end of March 1948

 stay there for a few hours
 on December 18
 writes Morris
 Pappé writes: 
 the 75
 for “Dalet”
 as Blatman suggests. But neither did it order that “neutral or friendly villages should be left untouched”
 brigade commanders were to use their own discretion in mounting operations against “enemy population centers”—meaning Arab towns and villages—by choosing between the following options: 
 blowing up
 the armed force must be wiped out and the population must be expelled outside the borders of the state. [66] 
 while Plan D allowed for Arab inhabitants to remain as long as they did not resist the takeover of their villages by the Zionist forces
 he explicitly notes that “brigade commanders were given the option ” of destroying Arab villages (emphasis added)—which would obviously necessitate expelling their inhabitants—regardless of whether any of the villagers offered any resistance. “The commanders were given discretion whether to evict the inhabitants of villages and urban neighborhoods sitting on vital access roads”
 “Villages were to be expelled in their entirety either because they were located in strategic spots or because they were expected to put up some sort of resistance. These orders were issued when it was clear that occupation would always provoke some resistance and that therefore no village would be immune

 political and economic balance between the two communities was such that not only were the majority of Jews in no danger at all
 Morris adds that in the larger urban areas with mixed populations

 most of the wealthy and middle-class families had fled Haifa. Far from ordering this evacuation
 but to kill the men. “The raiders moved from house to house
 writes Morris
 Sir Alan Cunningham
 and in a British-mediated meeting in the afternoon on April 22
 Morris attributed this flight solely to orders from the Arab leadership to leave the city
 then
 a single sentence in which Morris characterizes it as another example of how Arabs fled upon the orders of their leadership: “For example
 describing Lifta
 which included a club and two coffee houses. It attracted Jerusalemites as well
 according to the Consultancy [i.e.
1948
 I feel I am in a Jewish ( Ivrit ) city. This is a feeling I only had in Tel-Aviv or in an agricultural farm. It is true that not all of Jerusalem is Jewish
 in Morris’s own words
 as opposed to being expelled by the Zionist forces
 “the Arab inhabitants of the towns of Beit Shean (Beisan) and Safad had to be ‘harassed’ into flight”
 the Arabs sought a truce
 which “worked wonderfully”
 “To reinforce this ‘whispering
 Morris also noted with respect to the use of the verb “cleanse” to describe what happened throughout Palestine
 Morris himself used the term repeatedly in his discussion with Shavit
 a state would not have come into being. That has to be clear. It is impossible to evade it. Without uprooting of the Palestinians
 expulsion is not a war crime. I don’t think that the expulsions of 1948 were war crimes. You can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs. You have to dirty your hands. . . . 
 but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide—the annihilation of your people—I prefer ethnic cleansing. . . . 
000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them. There was no choice but to expel that population. . . . 
 which truly underwent a hard tragedy. I feel sympathy for the refugees themselves. But if the desire to establish a Jewish state here is legitimate
 he got cold feet during the war. In the end
 maybe he should have done a complete job. . . . 
 it will be because Ben-Gurion did not complete the transfer in 1948. Because he left a large and volatile demographic reserve in the West Bank and Gaza and within Israel itself. . . . 

 that would seem quite impossible
 let’s return to Morris’s arguments and address each in turn. 
 the goal of establishing a demographically “Jewish state” would require the “compulsory transfer”—to borrow Ben-Gurion’s phrase for it
 from mid-March onward
 Morris accused Blatman of attributing things to him that he had never claimed. Yet Morris himself had previously described what happened during the war as “ethnic cleansing”—and expressed his view that Ben-Gurion’s error was not doing a thorough enough job of it. 
 it does not follow that no ethnic cleansing occurred. In keeping with his comments to Ari Shavit
 there isn’t any ambiguity about the fact that they are recognized today as war crimes—and
 Morris’s assumptions that the UN partition plan was an equitable solution and that Resolution 181 lent legitimacy to the Zionists’ unilateral declaration of the existence of the state of Israel on May 14
 including Plan D
 Plan D did make explicit the operational orders to expel Arabs from their villages. Morris also suggests that since not all Arabs were expelled
 who “supported the transfer of Arabs” in the 1930s and early ‘40s
 he further acknowledges that the “atmosphere of transfer” still prevailed in April 1948
1948
 in light of this admission
 Morris acknowledges that the Zionist leadership as a matter of policy prevented the Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes. Indeed

 he has a point. Their very existence in the land constituted a destruction of the Zionists’ ideal. Hence they had to go. In Morris’s own words
 Morris’s hypocrisy is glaring. He knows perfectly well that most of those expelled were civilians who had taken no part in hostilities. Hence what he is really saying here is that it was “logical and just” for the civilian Arab population to have been collectively punished for the crime some among them committed of putting up resistance to the Zionists’ operations to seize control of the territory they wanted for their “Jewish state”—precisely the collective punishment that Haganah commanders were ordered to carry out under Plan D
 after all

 author of Ethnic Cleansing 
 in a 1999 report titled Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo: An Accounting 
 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) noted that the term “ethnic cleansing” was used in practice “to mean ‘rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area’”. [101] 
 ethnic cleansing is precisely what occurred in Palestine during the 1948 war. 
 “This book is written with the deep conviction that the ethnic cleansing of Palestine must become rooted in our memory and consciousness as a crime against humanity and that it should be excluded from the list of alleged crimes.” [102] 
 what happened in Palestine in 1948 was not an “alleged” ethnic cleansing

 he is the author of Obstacle to Peace: The US Role in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (2016)

Inside the war on coal
 the largest financial institution to flee the space to date

 no matter how compelling the economic logic. Beyond Coal does not just deploy data. It organizes rallies and petitions and float-ins on kayaks; it shames utility executives on billboards and airplane banners; it mobilizes its members to show up at boring hearings where showing up can make a difference. If the Oklahoma City case displayed the war on coal as a numerical dispute

 a blightscape of boarded-up bungalows

” says Alisha Winters

 and last year Republican Governor Rick Snyder’s administration floated a compliance plan that would have required DTE to upgrade the coal-fired River Rouge Power Plant or (more likely) close it. But DTE proposed an alternative plan with no costly upgrades

 physical and imaginary

 the River Rouge hearing was political

 Governor Snyder—whose top campaign supporters included one Michael Bloomberg—announced a new effort to cut Michigan’s reliance on coal. That would have been a huge political burden for Snyder if he had run for president in a GOP primary

 but utilities will face daunting investment decisions over the next two years. The EPA recently settled a sulfur lawsuit with the Sierra Club that could replicate the River Rouge dilemma across the nation. The agency has also imposed regional haze plans that already are replicating the Oklahoma dilemma in Arizona

 pushing Obama to drop his “all-of-the-above” approach to energy and formally enlist in the war on coal. Obama has not been as maniacally anti-coal as the industry suggests

 but we’ve still got a bureaucracy running amok

 the pace of retirements could slow. But it probably won’t stop. The trends are too strong. Nilles recently met with leaders of the utility Southern Company

 and the death of American coal would not avert a climate catastrophe if the rest of the world did not follow our lead. But the decline of American coal emissions will help U.S. negotiators insist that other countries do their part in the global negotiations in Paris. And while critics of climate action often grumble that it would be foolish for the U.S. to make sacrifices when China is still building a new coal plant every week

 no battleship treaty to mark the end. But Beyond Coal’s leaders believe they can finish most of their work setting the U.S. electric sector on a greener path over the next five years. The next phase of the war on carbon would be to try to electrify everything else—cars and trains that use oil-derived gasoline and diesel

 we’ll need to take on oil

 in the first-ever papal address to a Joint Meeting of Congress

 he said

 though

 the pope said

 Francis visited the Capitol's Statuary Hall and its statue of Father Junipero Serra

 and God bless America

 the pontiff's historic address stirred an energy and enthusiasm rarely seen at the Capitol

 including House Speaker John Boehner

 the pope said

 saying he believes in ""rehabilitation."" The pontiff who has been outspoken on the issue of climate change also said the ""environmental challenge we are undergoing and its human roots concern and affect us all."" He said the U.S. and Congress ""have an important role to play.""

 toward the end of his address



 R-Ohio

 with Democrats in particular delighting in his support for action to overhaul immigration laws and combat global warming and income inequality. One House Republican back-bencher announced plans to boycott the speech over Francis' activist position on climate change

 a former altar boy who invited Francis to speak after trying unsuccessfully to bring his two immediate predecessors

 Boehner said.

 the pope will depart later Thursday for New York for more prayer services and a speech to the United Nations.

 but a consolidation of Power. The Federal Reserve itself has undergone consolidation. And Wall Street. And Main Street. And soon… as we continue marching towards globalization via Conquest and Treaty and the expansion of Power… Our National Sovereignty. 
 alas
 and does stimulate the economy with monies spent on militaries
 be it public or private
 in addition to gold
 pray tell
 the reaction
 I will be not only applauding you

 in fact. It would just take time. 
 for example
 again
 author of ‘Grand Theft
 have checked out the IVAMU site. What happens if this ‘golden paper money’ is burnt to extract its gold content in the way that gold coins used to be ‘clipped’


 but it omits the one aspect that all such criticisms do: time. It is disingenuous to mis-match securities to day zero. Asking for every dollar loaned over widely varying periods of maturity to be immediately returned is nonsensical. To put it in microeconomic terms
 thank you! great post. web ether-net ideas 
 its just paper with very nice pictures.(the value is based on believe

 to make up for the fact that you’ve incurred a cost in going without the sugar and risked it never being returned. 
 so the premise of the article is bunk. Suppose the debt is to China
 so they can sell something to a dollar holder for cash. The cash can be used to repay debt
 when a debt is repaid with money it is the debt which disappears
 sound like he gets his “information” from mainstream media. Like listening to an exact recording of the “news” on national tv. Wake up FOOL
 but your forgetting that money is still just pieces of paper floating around. They really do not have value. Our goods and services are what really has value. How would it be mathematically impossible to pay back our debt with our goods and services when our debt has not yet even reached the dollar amount of all goods and services we produce in 1 year. Not even one year worth of our goods and services (GDP) would be needed to pay the debt back. We have had much higher debt in the past comparably. This is if you actually look at our debt compared to GDP. This is like you would look at your own debt compared to your income in your household. If my debt was equal to my income this year
 the founding fathers of the USA also said (iirc) that the people needed to be educated. For ppl (like me) who are not professionally in banking the money issue (in full) can seem complicated. I think that for sufficient political oversight #1 thing for a new system must be simplicity. Only what is simple people can understand
 legal tender law
 to prevent that sector from growing up those tiranical and corrupt corporations the USA founding fathers may have talked about. 
 the government never lends a single coin from anyone (only taxes). As a rule the (next) government never pays back loans
 what people expect too. To round it off: international businesses are prohibited henceforth
 if not why ? I personally don`t believe in gold / silver money that much. (Sorry to post such a long comment.) Bud Selig 
 Bankers and the “Elite” rule because the sheeple can’t grasp what is going on and are complacent slaves oblivious to puppeteers manipulations.

 let me make this simple. CHINA owns us. Technically
 The money is owed to yourself and other Americans. Social Security money has been wasted and effectively funded Wall Street Bonuses this year and last year. Same for other liabilities (medicare!). So
 and the people of this country didn’t sign anything agreeing to pay off loans that didn’t go to them. 
 confiscate every military base within its borders (they paid for them
 they print $1 or so for themselves; so
 Its actually worse than you portend. The theft is from each American in the way of Social Security

 on the take
 formally dissolve the USA Constitution

 they promised much more then the state could deliver to their overly vast military and other government run organizations. 
 you might even say that the west is so well developed because of its lending system…..but that’s just a thought

 Pelosi

 don’t spend it on the big corporations-give it to the local guy (even if its a little more expensive). 




 lying FED is doing is tacking on their MONEY-CHANGER fee. And we all know WHO the money changers are. They want to live a life of EXTREME wealth without having to work for it. Bob 
 but the money I was lent by the bank was pure invention from the bank… they did not have the money they lent me ( they legally need to have 10% ) of what they lend and the rest is AIR but I have to pay them interest on that AIR. It seems that the problem is the thiefs of the banking system and the Federal Reserve … and whoever profits from the interests on inexistent money… are the very persons who are taking the world’s economies hostage (some form of real slavery). The Federal Reserve + the banking system is THE problem. 

 being a canny Ulsterman survived many assassination attempts. 

 and own 50% of the world’s assets. 




 which through fractional reserve banking gives banks the power to create credit from nothing. The real problem is interest. When the money supply is expanded via fractional reserve banking it creates more money to be injected into the money supply. However loans also charge interest. Only the money created for the loan contract or principal is actually distributed in the money supply. The money to pay the interest is not created in the money supply
 its only shows how full of BS you really are. web ether-net ideas 
 or something of that sort… well for one person a dozen eggs can be worth a pound of flour

 actually i trust the fed alot more than i trust the (current) congress
 but not impossible thing to accomplish. Get Real

 this discussion ignores the effect of crude oil on banking and money. A comprehensive discussion includes the effect of the petrodollar system on our currency. With that
 which had value. But after president Nixon ended Brentton Woods act and eliminated gold standards US currency is backed by empty promises and the believe that US is GOOD FOR IT. Bankdog 
 may I suggest that you read “the Creature From Jekyll Island”. Or

 but it does. 

 sensationalistic statements do not help *anybody*. Wyatt Junker

 literally our very survival. We need to become grateful again for businesses who provide jobs rather than stigmatize them as greedy organizations. They create earnings. They create jobs. Not government. Therefore they get special rights as risk takers. 
 theoretically repatriating their assets back to the country


 they take it over. Grow it




 the Federal reserve turns over all its profits back to the treasury. So there really is no interest being paid to the Fed. 

 that’s right. Itself. All it is doing is stuffing a piggy bank full of dollar bills with IOU’s and then taking out actually currency. Mark 
 itself paper

 this insane system will be laughed at thousands of years from now. It’s so ridiculously stupid. I didn’t vote for Obama 
the Democrats or the person in Washington ethanallen 

 and now it is here. Tea 
 then how was it possible to create the debt? Wouldn’t your same logic apply to prove that it is *impossible* to get us in debt his far? 
 but all you are showing is that it’s impossible to pay off our national debt instantly (as in within a second). And nobody is proposing that anyway;) 
 like air. As long as have some trees around




 the point regarding value of the USD is that is comes out of nothing. Certain people can press a few computer buttons and create hundreds of billions of dollars. If one person has the power to create hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air
 the reason why the founders of the United States mandated that only gold and silver were money
 it has an extremely long and successful track record as being accepted as money
 why not for some famous US solutions: 1. Instigate a few wars and supply all countries/factions involved with US weapons. BIG profits! 2. Increase heroin production in Afghanistan and make young people in Eastern Europe/Asia drug dependent. Who cares? Big Continuous Profits! 3. Abolish the US$ and start another currency. Start over again. Foreign debt? Pooff
 let other people pay for their debt or create another paper illusion. Hetty 
 that is the Federal Reserve. What happened was that the risks were sold abroad as derivatives




 via an unofficial currency like Argentina’s credito. That
 (as Get Real pointed out) the Federal Reserve and its fiat note are unconstitutional. Only congress has the power to coin money. Simple
 down from 65%. 
 not the government. Gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years

 and simple…. 

 but the rest will be defaulted. 
 problems solved (and new problems created!) Ed Simple 

 you should look elsewhere for an education on how these systems work. The author doesn’t know. Don 
 the FED actually creates very little money in our fractional monetary system. In normal markets there is $800 Billion of US Treasury Notes (a debit entry) that has been moneterized into Federal Reserve Notes (a credit entry). Due to the enormous one-time (hopefully) money needs stemming from the fall-out of the credit crisis
 the majority of our money is created when banks make loans. When a banker makes a loan
 the money supply is tight right now because banks have been contracting their balance sheets. This is being done by tightening credit standards. When less credit is being issued by banks a contraction in the macro money supply occurs. Likewise
 part of the reason that the macro money supply is not expanding is due to loans losses that banks are taking due to the lack of supervision regarding the subprime debacle. When banks lose money
 the real threat to the US’s money supply is trade imbalances. When the US imports more goods and services than it exports
 debt based monetary systems are inherently dependent upon the money continuing to circulate. When people become scared and start hording money instead of keeping a healthy amount of it in circulation


 the American public has been decieved into thinking that worthless paper is “money”. What is needed is a return to a Consttutionally based monetary system. End the Federal Reserve


 8-9 years ago
 actually. I can’t believe you haven’t thought of this already. PleaseExpalin 

 or is it just an ideological issue? Admin 


 I’ve quite aware of what constitutes GDP. You might be surprised to know just how GDP is calculated in your country (I’m not an American BTW). Did you know that if you earn $100 and then spend that $100
 but there has to be some sort of physical asset that we can use as the cap for how much we can spent. That way if we need to pay back our debts
 or has a different definition of “mathematically impossible” than a mathematician does. As one example: 
 the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist. 
 does that dollar get removed from circulation? 
 it *circulates*. It’s what happens to money in an economy. Bronco 
 the question that puzzles me is – why China is giving us the money instead giving it to its own people whose living standard is way lower then ours? Danno Alex 
 you cannot “eat your gold”! 
 the most common reason that the price goes up or down in any given period is due to the strength (or weakness)of the paper currency used to buy it. 
 how I wish I had mortgaged the house and bought MORE! The spot price for 1 oz. American Eagles closed at $1121.50. My return in approximately 10 years would have been around 400%! Top THAT

 you will see the folly of keeping your wealth in paper dollars! 
 you can’t spend gold at the hardware store or at Wal-Mart but when the dust clears and a new currency replaces the failed one
 you can rest assured those people probably make money by peddling paper “investments”. 


 stop the increase so a plan can be made to reduce what is already in. As people can not find jobs and have time on their hands bartering will become more common

 which is what I recollected. 



 (as soon as you buy it the car is worth $20k or less)

 the other way is to _work off the debt_. luckily
 it’s what you spend the money on! Rampart 
000 years. It is a reliable store of wealth because it can’t be printed out of thin air. If you think fiat currency is as good as gold
 our dollars were in fact backed by gold. Since abandoning the gold standard

 the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist” 
 except in very primitive economies. Even on the gold standard that was true. John Sawyer 

 




 so why do we not do that? Is there any real practical problem with that
 let it all burn down around you as social disorder asserts itself
 and he was not the 1st President to be killed for this reason

 but it really doesnt make sense to “trade” anything. If you just gave people what they needed from what you were producing

That Obama is running around supporting her effort to get elected President using government transport to do so is another problem she has. When both of them are being transported on Air Force One

 america is worse. The pirates are only in africa. What about Europe where I personally know life is nicer and less stressful. Well that depends if material stuff is important of course (most all of the americans I met in my 31yrs abroad where consumed with being matwerialistic or tryng too hard to be destitute losers. I want to leave soon but my [partner is an american and so is our daughter. Although I grew up in Europe I am trapped in the U.S. It is verty hard. I have never found a more superficial
 I’m Latin American so I could move back to my country or to another Latin country with low restrictions on immigration. However
 I don’t know where to go


 I sure wouldn’t be posting about it on The Economic Collapse Blog. I’d be off surfing on my private island in Tahiti. 


 wich is everywhere. BeenThere 
 the police are far more corrupt than they generally are in the United States”. I find that hard to believe Max Never the less
 that corruption can be taken advantage of… Always keep a $20 dollar bill on you


 there is definitely a bias against Americans in particular. It is based on the fact that they get lots of stuff from TV and are ignorant as well; and also
 I find the idea of leaving the states not only a necessary truth for me and my families’ survival
 now after that America does just suck and seem filled with artificial people and things at this point in history. Seeing from another perspective cemented for me that our culture is vile and we are a moral sewer. Seeing the attack on George Zimmerman was almost more than I could bear. We have turned into a seething cesspool. 
 the grass is always greener and even though America is in bad shape

 even 6 years ago. Those days are gone for good. We need to be clear eyed on moving ahead on our principles. 
 I hear the Star Spangled Banner and scoff these days


 white people are that sick and evil. Sequoia 
t fair just to point the finger at one race or people. And about Zimmerman
 his father is Ashkenazy Jew not European! His mother is native Peruvian Indian with a black father! I’m white European 
 BUT…they ARE much happier and more friendly people. I have experienced that for myself when I have been in other countries. As a side note

 online businesses
 rules (though where I lived the banks were MUCH better
will be screwed when the S#!T hits the fan and the USA goes bankrupt completely. If you relocate to another country
 as much as I love America
 you begin to realize that the government is simply going to tax you to death. They have no other strategy to cope with the massive debt they have incurred. 


 the place would close down and her friends would commit suicide and the teachers would quit… well
 I pretty much agree. But you cannot deny that we have a strong tradition of liberty here that many people still carry. Just saying.

 learn a new foreign language

 and I keep telling people
 or an Asian language only person. But I will meet God one day. I know I have ticked Him off enough already and He still forgives me. The least I could do is speak His language when I meet Him face to face. sherpeace 


 i.e. you can actually bump into a member of Parliament or a government minister on the street…. without them having a phalanx of security guards. There is no oppressive police presence. Only 4.5 million people in a country the size of Japan. Yes it is on the ring-of-fire but nothing is without risk. USKiwi 

 however viewing it on a map is a bit of a fright. It’s strange

 most Americans descended from immigrants








 while order is stagnation. 
 you need progressives for that. 
 that even the most progressive become conservative and eventually are left behind when they do not progress themselves. davidmpark 


 we had no choice but to go on it. They don’t supply enough for a whole month – enough for 2 people; not 5.

 the better off we will be. Maria S Biddle 
 this is home and I will fight for her
 va comes to mind. mary 
 as should we all. We help bring more of them to middle class



 but there is the potential for social cataclysm in many parts of the world. I don’t think the UK will survive as we have too many people compared to local resources; we only survive because of fraudulent banking practices of the City of London Corporation. 
 Australia and New Zealand. If you add Germany
 and that this is something worth fighting for. markthetruth 


 I will stay. All of us have the choice to run
